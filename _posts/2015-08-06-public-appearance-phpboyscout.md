So it's finally happened!

I stood up in front of a group of developers and gave a lightning talk about how Scouting Principles should be applied to every day development.

\[slideshare id=51344270&doc=areyouagoodscout-150806121954-lva1-app6892\]

The amazing thing is that I didn't get any rotten tomatoes thrown at me! quite the contrary in fact. Even with me doing the talk in full Scout uniform.

Now to see about finding some more places to speak and actually fleshing out the talk into something that can last a full hour and not just shy of 5 minutes.
