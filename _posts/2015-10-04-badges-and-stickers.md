One of the most prominent things I've been asked about regarding my promoting being a Good Code Scout, is where can we get the badges?

Following on from a number of questions and subsequent tweets about it

Well... I've decided that (providing I can get permission from all the right people) I'll start creating a range of Badges & Stickers for you to earn as a Good Code Scout.

So if your interested in having some stickers or badges let me know using the form below and if I get enough interest I will most definitely get some made up for you.

## Update

Unfortunately I'm have no more stickers left, Though I'll be working on diversifying some of the designs in the near future I wont be looking at ordering any more for a little while yet. Keep your eyes on twitter as I'll most likely post there when they are available again.
