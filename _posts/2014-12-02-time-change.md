So... Its been a long time since I posted anything of any relevance. This is due to having been super busy with my previous company Zucchi.

However that has all changed now! After three and a half years of running my own company I have decided that its not for me. I gave it my all, but in the end I was becoming too much of a Salesman and I missed getting stuck in with code.

I've now moved on and have joined the fantastic team at Magma Digital who have been leaders in PHP software development for somewhere in the region of 14 years as well as heavily involved in the PHP community having been a essential part of the PHPNW user group and conference.

This means I should be able to pick up where I left off all those years ago and start being more active again.

See you soon
